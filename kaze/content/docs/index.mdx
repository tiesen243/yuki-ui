Yuki UI is a collection of reusable components built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) that follows a copy-paste methodology. Unlike traditional component libraries, Kaze UI components are meant to be copied directly into your project, giving you complete ownership and control over the code.

## Philosophy

Our library extends the shadcn/ui approach - instead of importing components from a package, you copy the source code directly into your project. This means:

- **No version conflicts** - Components evolve with your project
- **Full customization** - Modify components to fit your exact needs
- **No dependency bloat** - Only include what you actually use
- **Complete ownership** - The code is yours to adapt and maintain

## Getting Started

Each component page includes:

1. A live preview to see the component in action
2. Source code ready to copy into your project
3. Installation instructions (CLI or manual copy-paste)
4. Required dependencies

### Installation Methods

#### CLI Installation

We provide installation through the shadcn CLI for quick addition of components:

<InstallComponent comp='{name}' />

#### Manual Installation

Don't want to use the CLI? Each component page includes step-by-step instructions for manual installation.

## Technology Stack

Yuki UI is built with modern web technologies:

- **React** - Component-based UI development
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe code with enhanced IDE support
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Radix UI** - Unstyled, accessible component primitives
- **shadcn/ui** - Foundational component architecture

## Customization

Since you own the code, customization is unlimited. Each component uses Tailwind CSS and CSS variables, making theme adjustments straightforward and consistent.
